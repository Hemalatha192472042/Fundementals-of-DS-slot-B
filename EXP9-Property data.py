#9. Scenario: You work for a real estate agency and have been given a dataset containing information  about properties for sale. The dataset is stored in a 
#Pandas DataFrame named property_data. The  DataFrame has columns for property ID, location, number of bedrooms, area in square feet, and listing  price. 
#Your task is to analyze the data and answer specific questions about the properties. 
#Question: Using Pandas DataFrame operations, how would you find the following information from  the property_data DataFrame: 
#1. The average listing price of properties in each location. 
#2. The number of properties with more than four bedrooms. 
#3. The property with the largest area. 




import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("../Datasets/property_data.csv")
avg_price = df.groupby("Location")["ListingPrice"].mean()

print("Average Listing Price by Location")
print(avg_price)
count = len(df[df["Bedrooms"] > 4])

print("\nProperties with More Than 4 Bedrooms =", count)
largest = df.loc[df["Area"].idxmax()]

print("\nProperty with Largest Area")
print(largest)

# Draw Bar Graph
avg_price.plot(kind="bar")

plt.title("Average Listing Price by Location")
plt.xlabel("Location")
plt.ylabel("Average Listing Price")

plt.show()
